<h1 class="text-center">Why is this Important?</h1>
<h4 class="text-left parg"><%= @tab %>This is an important revolution because it not only involved fighting amongst a nation but with other nations as well. This revolution contained many different nations that were all affected. It also opened the way for more revolutions in the middle east to start. The Iraq Revolution was not just about improving the lives of the civilians but also about gaining their own independence. They fought to close of the connections between their country and those who tried to manipulate them. They helped other nations around them realize that they did not need to blindly follow the instruction of greater nations when they themselves can control their own government. Very few other Revolutions can say that not only did they affect their own society but also the society of those around them. The Iraq Revolution shows that a revolution can be help many nations not just the one it is fought in.</h4>
